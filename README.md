## Description

Fairly basic GraphQL API, for now just creates a user KEKW

## Environment and tools

Certify to have Docker and Node.js installed to run it

## Steps to run and debug

Create a .env file with the same content of .env.sample, open the terminal in the root directory, and run:

```
$ npm install
$ docker-compose up -d
$ npm start
```

Now the server should be running in <http://localhost:5000>
